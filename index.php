            Newport Community Volunteering is a small home grown organization 
            of local residents in the Newport, North Carolina area who want to 
            help out in their free time.  We find people and events in need in 
            Carteret County and the neighboring counties that need help and 
            provide an easy platform for people to sign up and show up to help!

                <dl>Recently Completed Community Events:
                <dt>Stray Round Up - October 15th</dt>   
                    <dd>Carteret County residents came together to find all
                        the animals without homes roaming the streets.  By the
                        end of the day, we had rescued ten animals in need and 
                        found them a home.
                        </dd>
                <dt>Feed the Homeless - September 10th</dt>    
                    <dd>It is unfortunate but there are people without homes
                        in Newport and the surrounding areas that cannot find
                        enough to eat.  With the help of all our volunteers, we
                        were able to put together a feast fit for a king.  No 
                        one went hungry that night.</dd>
                <dt>Build a shed - August 5th</dt>
                    <dd>For the inaugural kickoff of Newport Community 
                        Volunteering, residents came together to help a resident
                        in need.  John Lewis lost his shed with Hurricane Ann.  
                        After a full day of dedicated work, our volunteers were 
                        able to rebuild a bigger and better shed!</dd>
