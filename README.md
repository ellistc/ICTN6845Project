# ICTN6845Project

I designed a hypothetical Community Volunteering website for a local community.  Users can access the website, see all the available events
in the future, and sign up for them.  They can also remove themselves from the events.  An administrator can access a backend webpage to
add or remove new events.  He needs to log into that area and can log out of it.  The page is designed with HTML, PHP, Java script, and
mysql.  The webpage can be accessed at timellis.000webhostapp.com/.  I used open source from three different places as base code to modify.
I labeled the locations in the code.
